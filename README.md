#Project 3: Finite state machine

    We know as much as possible about how the associated gear bringing the information to the tracker operates and how all the gear from the tracker to the gun operates. So we have the human operator surrounded on both sides by very precisely known mechanisms and the question comes up, "What kind of machine have we placed in the middle?"

In this project you will create a abstract machine known as a finite state machine. The finite state machine is capable of represent a number of states or conditions. From each state, it can transition to certain (but usually not all) other states. This is often represented by a graph with a series of box/circles and arrows. It can also be represented by a series of interlinked webpages. That is how you will make your machine. 

You will create a website with at least five separate states(pages). Each state should allow the user to transition(link) to some of the other pages. For this project you will need to spend some time mapping out your machine. You should include this map as part of your finished project. Once that is designed you can begin to think of how the machine will appear to viewer and what will change about that appearance in each state.

While you can conceive of your machine as simply that, it could also represent a pet, a series of rooms in a house or building, a vehicle, an environment or perhaps a person with a particularly dull and predictable life.

One thing to keep in mind is that from the perspective of the viewer your machine is a single entity that is simply changing its condition/mood/etc. in response to their input. You should think about the machines user interface. Does it give clues to the user as to what each action will cause the machine to do? Should it? Do the states communicate something new to the user when they change? Is it positive, negative or neutral?
